# Detection Risks — GitHub Actions vs Local

The browser automation code is identical between local and GHA runs, but there are differences that could flag traffic as non-human.

---

## 1. Predictable Daily Volume

**Risk:** Sending exactly 4,800 attempts every single day (200 × 24 runs) is a clear fingerprint. Any system logging traffic volume would spot the pattern immediately.

**Fix:** Randomise the `--count` per run so the daily total lands in the 4,000–5,000 range without ever hitting the same number twice.

```yaml
COUNT=$((RANDOM % 42 + 167))   # random 167–208 per run
# Min day:  167 × 24 = 4,008
# Max day:  208 × 24 = 4,992
# Average: ~187 × 24 = 4,488
```

**Status:** Not yet implemented — replace hardcoded `'200'` in `admaven.yml`.

---

## 2. Timing Regularity


**Risk:** GHA cron fires at exact scheduled times (e.g. `0 * * * *` = exactly on the hour). Real users never arrive that predictably.

**Fix:** Add a random sleep at the start of the GHA workflow step, before the Python script runs. This shifts the actual browser activity to an unpredictable time within the scheduled window.

```yaml
- name: Run automation
  run: |
    sleep $((RANDOM % 1800))   # random delay up to 30 min
    python3 run.py --admaven --count $COUNT --concurrency $CONC --logs
```

**Status:** Not yet implemented — add to `admaven.yml`.

---

## 3. No Persistent Cookies / Storage

**Risk:** Every GHA run starts with a clean browser profile. A real returning user would have cookies, localStorage, and session history.

**Fix:** Use Playwright's `storageState` to save browser state at the end of a run and restore it at the start of the next. Store the state file as a GitHub Actions cache artifact keyed by repo.

```python
# Save at end of run
await context.storage_state(path="browser_state.json")

# Restore at start of next run
context = await browser.new_context(storage_state="browser_state.json", ...)
```

In the workflow, save/restore `browser_state.json` using `actions/cache`.

**Status:** Not yet implemented.

## 4. Concurrency Pattern

**Risk:** 10 browser instances start within seconds of each other from different IPs all hitting the same locker URLs — unnatural burst pattern.

**Fix:** The code already has a `start_delay` parameter per instance. Increase the spread from a few seconds to 0–120s random delay so instances are distributed over 2 minutes rather than launching together.

```python
start_delay = random.uniform(0, 120)  # currently too tight — widen this
```

**Status:** Partially implemented (`start_delay` exists but window is narrow). Widen the range.

---

## 5. GHA Runner IP Leak

**Risk:** GitHub Actions runner IPs are publicly known. If the target site checks the request origin before the proxy is established, the runner IP leaks.

**Fix:** Already handled. When Playwright is configured with a proxy, it sends the full hostname to the proxy server for resolution — DNS never resolves locally. The runner IP never reaches the target site.

No code change needed. Confirmed by checking that `result["ip"]` in logs always shows a residential Evomi IP, never a GitHub IP range.

**Status:** Already mitigated.

---

## 6. No Real Dwell Time

**Risk:** The automation clicks through tasks faster than any human could read and interact. This timing pattern can be fingerprinted.

**Fix:** Add random pre-click delays per task to simulate a user reading before acting, and a random post-click wait before moving to the next task.

```python
await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(2, 8))   # before clicking a task
await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(1, 4))   # after tab opens/closes
```

Also consider randomising the order in which tasks are clicked rather than always going top-to-bottom.

**Status:** Not yet implemented — add delays inside the task click loop in `admaven.py`.

## What Works in Our Favour

- Evomi residential proxy IPs — look like real users from real countries
- Random device fingerprints per run (53 profiles across iPhone and Android)
- Playwright with a real browser engine (not detectable as a headless bot)
- Country-targeted proxies (high-CPM countries = high-quality residential IPs)
- 60/40 mix of high-CPM and any-country proxies for traffic diversity
- DNS routed through proxy — runner IP never reaches the target site
